# Project Progress Log

## 2025-06-23: General Testing & Documentation

**Objective:** Solidify the application's stability by enhancing the test suite and documenting the architecture for future development.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Test Suite Enhancement (`FileUpload.test.tsx`):**
    *   Reviewed the existing tests for the `FileUpload` component.
    *   Added a new test case to handle the scenario where a user opens the file dialog but cancels without selecting a file. This ensures the `onFileSelect` callback is not incorrectly triggered.

2.  **Test Execution & Validation:**
    *   Executed the entire frontend test suite using `vitest`.
    *   All 21 tests passed successfully, confirming that the recent UI/UX polish and the new test case did not introduce any regressions.

**Outcome:** The testing for the `FileUpload` component is now more comprehensive, and the stability of the frontend application is validated. The project is now ready for the final documentation steps.

## 2025-06-23: UI/UX Polish & Test Suite Stabilization

**Objective:** Refine the application's user interface using a modern component library (Shadcn/UI) and fix all outstanding issues in the Vitest test suite to ensure application stability and correctness.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Shadcn/UI Integration:**
    *   Installed and configured Shadcn/UI, a component library built on Tailwind CSS, to modernize the application's look and feel.
    *   Initialized the project with the necessary dependencies, including `lucide-react` for icons.
    *   Updated `tsconfig.json` and `vite.config.ts` with the required path aliases (`@/`).

2.  **HomePage Refactoring (`HomePage.tsx`):**
    *   Redesigned the layout using a two-column grid for better organization.
    *   Replaced standard HTML elements with Shadcn/UI components (`Card`, `Button`, `Progress`).
    *   Implemented `sonner` for toast notifications to provide non-blocking feedback for success, error, and info states, replacing the previous inline error messages.
    *   Added a progress bar and descriptive messages to give users clear feedback during the audiobook generation process.

3.  **ChapterList Refactoring (`ChapterList.tsx`):**
    *   Updated the chapter list to use Shadcn/UI components for a consistent design.
    *   Replaced previous status text with a `Badge` component to clearly indicate chapter status (`Pending`, `Complete`, `Error`).
    *   Integrated `lucide-react` icons for play, pause, download, and status indicators, improving visual clarity.

4.  **Test Suite Stabilization & Debugging:**
    *   **`tsconfig.json` Fix:** Added `"vitest/globals"` to the `compilerOptions.types` array to resolve widespread TypeScript errors where Vitest's global functions (`vi`, `describe`, `test`) were not recognized.
    *   **`ChapterList.test.tsx` Fix:** Corrected a major syntax error caused by a duplicated, malformed test block at the end of the file.
    *   **`HomePage.test.tsx` Fixes:**
        *   Updated the Supabase client mock to ensure the `unsubscribe` method returns a resolved promise, preventing a `TypeError` during test cleanup.
        *   Corrected the `TEXTAREA_PLACEHOLDER` constant to exactly match the new, more descriptive placeholder text in the `HomePage` component, fixing a critical `getByPlaceholderText` query failure.
        *   Updated an assertion to check for the new "Complete" badge text instead of the old status text.
        *   Removed an obsolete assertion that was checking for an old error message format (`/Error:/i`), aligning the test with the new toast-based error notifications.
        *   Cleaned up unused variables and imports to resolve linter warnings.

**Outcome:** The application's UI/UX has been significantly polished, providing a more modern, intuitive, and informative user experience. The entire test suite is now stable, with all 20 tests passing reliably. This confirms that the new UI is functioning correctly and that the application's core logic remains robust. The project is now ready for the final documentation phase.

## 2025-06-18: Vertical Slice 3 - Download Functionality & UI Polish

**Objective:** Implement the ability for users to download generated audio files for individual chapters and perform initial UI cleanup.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Download Button Implementation:**
    *   Added a "Download" button to the `ChapterList.tsx` component. This button appears next to the "Play" button for any chapter with a `status` of 'complete'.
    *   The `onDownloadChapter` handler function was added to the component's props to manage the download logic.

2.  **Download Handler Logic:**
    *   Implemented the `handleDownloadChapter` function in `HomePage.tsx`.
    *   This function retrieves the chapter's public `audio_url` from Supabase Storage.
    *   It then programmatically creates a temporary anchor (`<a>`) element, sets the `href` to the audio URL and the `download` attribute to a user-friendly filename (e.g., `EbookTitle_chapter_1.mp3`), and simulates a click to trigger the browser's download functionality.

3.  **Testing and Validation:**
    *   Created a new unit test in `ChapterList.test.tsx` to verify that the download button renders correctly for completed chapters.
    *   The test also confirms that the `onDownloadChapter` function is called with the correct chapter ID when the button is clicked.
    *   Ran the entire frontend test suite (`npm test`), and all 20 tests passed, confirming the new feature works as expected and did not introduce any regressions.

4.  **Code Refactoring & Cleanup:**
    *   Identified and removed the unused `ebookId` prop from the `ChapterList` component to improve code clarity.
    *   Refactored the chapter items in `ChapterList.tsx` to use the `role="listitem"` attribute, which improves accessibility and resolves type errors in the test suite by providing a more reliable way to select elements.

**Outcome:** The core download functionality for Vertical Slice 3 is now implemented, tested, and validated. Users can now download the audio for completed chapters directly from the UI. The codebase has also been cleaned up, resolving previous linting issues.

## 2025-06-16: Frontend Project Initialization & Troubleshooting

**Objective:** Set up the basic frontend project structure using Vite, React, and TypeScript.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Initial Scaffolding Attempt (Manual File Creation):**
    *   Created the `frontend` directory.
    *   Manually created core project files:
        *   `frontend/package.json` (with initial dependencies: `react`, `react-dom`, and devDependencies: `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `eslint`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`, `typescript`, `vite`).
        *   `frontend/vite.config.ts` (basic Vite configuration with React plugin).
        *   `frontend/tsconfig.json` (TypeScript configuration for the project).
        *   `frontend/tsconfig.node.json` (TypeScript configuration for Node.js specific files like `vite.config.ts`).
        *   `frontend/index.html` (main HTML entry point).
        *   `frontend/src/main.tsx` (React application entry point).
        *   `frontend/src/App.tsx` (root React component).
        *   `frontend/src/index.css` (global styles).
        *   `frontend/src/App.css` (App component specific styles).
        *   `frontend/src/vite-env.d.ts` (TypeScript definitions for Vite environment variables).
    *   Ran `npm install` in the `frontend` directory to install dependencies.

2.  **Troubleshooting `npm run dev` Command:**
    *   **Initial Error:** `sh: vite: command not found`.
        *   **Attempt 1:** Modified `package.json` script `dev` to `npx vite`. Still resulted in `vite: command not found` or `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `vite.config.ts`.
        *   **Attempt 2:** Clean re-installation of dependencies (`rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`). Issue persisted.
        *   **Attempt 3:** Modified `package.json` script `dev` to `node ./node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js`. Resulted in `Error: Cannot find module '/Users/anastasiakim/HarmonicAIv3/frontend/node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js'`.
        *   **Diagnosis:** Listing `frontend/node_modules/vite/bin` confirmed the directory did not exist, indicating `npm install` was failing silently to install `vite` correctly.
        *   **Attempt 4:** Cleared npm cache (`npm cache clean --force`), removed `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, and ran `npm install` again. Issue persisted.
        *   **Diagnosis:** Listing `frontend/node_modules` confirmed the entire directory was not being created by `npm install`.

3.  **Resolution (Environment Fix by User):**
    *   The user identified and resolved a local Node.js/npm environment issue by performing a clean re-installation of Node.js and npm using `nvm` (Node Version Manager).
    *   After the environment fix, `npm install` in the `frontend` directory successfully created the `node_modules` directory and installed all dependencies.
    *   The `npm run dev` command (using `npx vite` in `package.json`) then successfully started the Vite development server.

**Outcome:** The basic Vite + React + TypeScript frontend project is now successfully initialized and the development server is running. The project is ready for further development, including the installation of UI libraries and other core dependencies.

## 2025-06-16: Supabase Project Setup & Frontend Integration

**Objective:** Configure the Supabase backend project (database, storage) and integrate the Supabase client into the frontend application.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Database Schema Definition:**
    *   Created SQL migration files in `supabase/migrations/`:
        *   `0001_create_ebooks_table.sql`: Defines the `ebooks` table to store information about uploaded e-books.
        *   `0002_create_chapters_table.sql`: Defines the `chapters` table to store individual chapters or sections of e-books, linked to the `ebooks` table.
    *   The USER executed these SQL scripts in their Supabase project dashboard via the SQL Editor to create the tables.

2.  **Storage Bucket Creation:**
    *   The USER created two storage buckets in the Supabase project dashboard:
        *   `ebook-uploads`: A private bucket for storing raw uploaded TXT, EPUB, and PDF files.
        *   `audiobook-outputs`: A public bucket (for MVP simplicity) for storing generated MP3 audio chapters.

3.  **Environment Variable Configuration:**
    *   Created `frontend/.env.example` as a template for Supabase credentials.
    *   The USER created `frontend/.env.local` and populated it with their actual Supabase Project URL and `anon` key from the Supabase dashboard.

4.  **Frontend Supabase Client Integration:**
    *   Installed the `@supabase/supabase-js` library in the `frontend` project (`npm install @supabase/supabase-js`).
    *   Created `frontend/src/supabaseClient.ts` to initialize and export the Supabase client, using the environment variables from `.env.local`.

**Outcome:** The Supabase project is configured with the necessary database schema and storage buckets. The frontend application is now equipped with the Supabase client library and a client instance, ready for interacting with the backend.

## 2025-06-17: Vertical Slice 2 - EPUB/PDF Support, Audio Generation & Realtime Updates

**Objective:** Implement the core application flow, allowing users to upload various document types, have them processed into chapters, generate audio, and see live status updates on the frontend.

**Backend Steps & Debugging:**

1.  **Edge Function Implementation:**
    *   Developed `upload-ebook` function to handle TXT, EPUB, and PDF files, parse them, and create corresponding `ebooks` and `chapters` records in the database.
    *   Developed `generate-audio-batch` function to process pending chapters, call the ElevenLabs API for TTS, and upload the resulting audio to Supabase Storage.

2.  **Database & Realtime Troubleshooting:**
    *   **RLS Policies:** Enabled Row Level Security (RLS) on `ebooks` and `chapters` tables and created public read policies to allow the frontend to fetch data.
    *   **REPLICA IDENTITY:** Diagnosed and fixed an issue where Realtime updates were not sending the full data payload. Set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` for both tables via a database migration (`0006_set_replica_identity_full.sql`).
    *   **Schema Updates:** Added an `error_message` column to the `chapters` table to better surface backend errors to the UI.

3.  **Supabase Environment Troubleshooting:**
    *   **PostgreSQL Version Conflict:** Resolved a critical local environment blocker where a Supabase CLI upgrade caused a PostgreSQL major version mismatch (v15 vs v17.4). The issue was fixed by resetting the database (`supabase db reset`), which allowed the new version to initialize correctly.
    *   **CORS Errors:** Fixed a CORS issue where the Edge Functions rejected requests from the frontend because the Vite dev server was running on a non-whitelisted port (5174 vs 5173). The shared `cors.ts` file was updated to allow all origins (`*`) for local development.
    *   **Storage Bucket Creation:** Resolved a recurring "Bucket not found" error during audio upload. Created a new migration (`0007_create_storage_buckets.sql`) to automatically create the required `ebook-uploads` and `audiobook-outputs` storage buckets and set the necessary public read policies. This was applied via a final `supabase db reset`.

**Frontend Steps & Debugging:**

1.  **UI Component Implementation:**
    *   Developed `FileUpload.tsx` and `ChapterList.tsx` components.
    *   Integrated these into `HomePage.tsx` to create the main user interface for uploading files and viewing chapter status.

2.  **Realtime Integration & Debugging:**
    *   Implemented a Supabase Realtime subscription in `HomePage.tsx` to listen for changes to the `chapters` table.
    *   Added extensive diagnostic logging to trace the flow of data from the backend to the frontend state.
    *   **Race Condition Fix:** Resolved the final bug where the UI would not update. A race condition was occurring where audio generation was requested before the Realtime subscription was fully active. The logic was refactored to trigger audio generation *only after* the `SUBSCRIBED` event was received, guaranteeing the UI would catch all subsequent status updates.

**Outcome:** The end-to-end flow for the application is now fully functional and validated. Users can upload a file, the backend processes it, generates audio, and the frontend UI reflects the status changes in real-time without requiring a manual refresh. The core functionality of the application is complete.

## 2025-06-16: Basic Frontend Application Structure & Routing

**Objective:** Establish the foundational directory structure for the frontend application and implement basic navigation using React Router.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Directory Structure Creation:**
    *   Created the standard project directories within `frontend/src/` to organize components, pages, services, store, hooks, assets, and utility functions:
        *   `frontend/src/assets`
        *   `frontend/src/components`
        *   `frontend/src/hooks`
        *   `frontend/src/pages`
        *   `frontend/src/services`
        *   `frontend/src/store`
        *   `frontend/src/utils`
    *   Added a `.gitkeep` file to each empty directory to ensure they are tracked by Git.

2.  **Placeholder Home Page:**
    *   Created `frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` with a simple welcome message to serve as the initial landing page.

3.  **React Router Setup:**
    *   Modified `frontend/src/main.tsx` to wrap the root `App` component with `<BrowserRouter>` from `react-router-dom`, enabling client-side routing.
    *   Updated `frontend/src/App.tsx` to replace the default Vite content with a `<Routes>` component. Defined a single route (`<Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />`) to render the `HomePage` component at the application's root URL.

4.  **Testing:**
    *   Created `frontend/src/App.test.tsx` with Vitest and React Testing Library to automatically verify:
        *   The `HomePage` component renders correctly when navigating to the root path (`/`).
        *   An unknown path does not inadvertently render the `HomePage` content.
    *   All tests passed, confirming the routing setup is functional.
    *   Manual verification by running `npm run dev` and navigating to the root URL confirmed the `HomePage` displays as expected.

**Outcome:** The frontend application now has a well-defined directory structure and basic routing capabilities. The `HomePage` serves as the entry point, and the setup is validated by automated tests. This completes Phase 1 of the project setup.
